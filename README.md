# AR_ImageTracking
Tracking an image to spawn a dragon that you can control with a toggle. 

🌟 About the Project:

Creating an immersive experience at museums for users by image tracking and spawing a animation out of it that can be controlled using the toggle. This project was built on Unity for an iOS Device. The Vision was to create an interactive experience for people to connect with art and create an unforgettable memory that alters with the current version of reality. 

This app will help create an animation when the camera faces a certain image (in this case - a painting). The user will be able to control the animation using the toggle to help it navigate through the space.
